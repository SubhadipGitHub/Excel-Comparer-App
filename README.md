# Data Comparer Application

## Overview

The Data Comparer Application is a desktop tool designed to compare data between two Excel or CSV files. It allows users to upload files, select columns for comparison, and identify any mismatches in data between the files.

## Features

- Upload Excel or CSV files.
- Select columns from each file to compare.
- Identify mismatches between selected columns.
- Generate an Excel file listing the mismatches.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library
- `openpyxl` library (for Excel file support)
- `tkinter` library (for GUI)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datacomparer.git
   cd datacomparer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - **On Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Upload Files:**
   - Click "Upload File 1" to select the first file (Excel or CSV).
   - Click "Upload File 2" to select the second file (Excel or CSV).

3. **Select Columns:**
   - After uploading the files, select columns from each file that you want to compare.

4. **Compare Data:**
   - Click "Compare Data" to start the comparison.
   - If there are any mismatches, an Excel file (`mismatches.xlsx`) will be generated listing the discrepancies.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the application:

1. Click "Upload File 1" and select `file1.xlsx`.
2. Click "Upload File 2" and select `file2.csv`.
3. Select a column from `file1.xlsx` and a column from `file2.csv` in the dropdowns.
4. Click "Compare Data" to find mismatches.
